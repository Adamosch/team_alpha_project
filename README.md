# What is it? :books: :bowtie: :poodle:

Bookshelfy is designed as an app for private books sharing. It is suppoused to be more than just a private library. It is made for bookwarms, who want to share their favourite pieces, talk about them and build a flourishing community. Assuming people still want to read analog books and would like to share them with others, this app will be a great success!
